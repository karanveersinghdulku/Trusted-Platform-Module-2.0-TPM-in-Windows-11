Researched and documented the TPM 2.0 standard by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), exploring how hardware-based Root of Trust establishes foundational security in modern computing.

Technical Coverage-->

TPM 2.0 architecture: PCRs, cryptographic engines (RSA, ECC, SHA-256, AES), secure key storage, cryptographic subsystems, and secure I/O operations.

Implementation types: Discrete, Integrated, firmware TPM (fTPM), virtual TPM

Secure Boot (UEFI signature verification) vs Measured Boot (cryptographic attestation)

Security vulnerabilities: Evaluated security vulnerabilities including TPM-FAIL (timing side-channel attacks) and faulTPM (hardware fault injection attacks)

Practical Application Demo: Demonstrated real-world TPM usage through hands-on exploration of Windows 11 security features, PCR extend operations, event logs, and remote attestation processes for zero-trust architectures.

This research highlighted the critical role of hardware security modules in protecting against rootkits, bootkits, and firmware-level threats in critical infrastructure and enterprise environments.
